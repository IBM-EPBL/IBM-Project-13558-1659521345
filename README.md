**Project Description :**
<p align="justify"> 
Forest fires are a major environmental issue, creating economic and ecological damage while endangering human lives. There are typically about 100,000 wildfires in the United States every year. Over 9 million acres of land have been destroyed due to treacherous wildfires. It is difficult to predict and detect Forest Fire in a sparsely populated forest area and it is more difficult if the prediction is done using ground-based methods like Camera or Video-Based approach. Satellites can be an important source of data prior to and also during the Fire due to its reliability and efficiency. The various real-time forest fire detection and prediction approaches, with the goal of informing the local fire authorities.</p>
